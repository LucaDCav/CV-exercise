<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
  I am an enthusiastic person that enjoys sports and team based
  activities. In my spare time I enjoy reading (especially Asian Comics),
  puzzles and playing games or challenging board games with friends.
  I try to partake as often as I can in new adventures, and extremely
  fond of acquiring new knowledge such as programming languages or
  cultural differences around the world.
