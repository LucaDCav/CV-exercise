  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <pre>
      I am an Industrial and Manufacturing Engineer, who is passionate about
      delivering high quality work that exceeds expectations. I also believe
      that our working environment mustn’t be only a place for hard work,
      self-development and pursuing greatness, but also a place for
      team-working, having fun and a space for communication, debates and
      doubts. I have recently focused my skills and expertise as a Data
      Analyst and Software Engineer trying always to deliver the best solution
      as well as a high-end analysis. I face daily difficulties/problems not as
      something bad but as an opportunity to improve and show even higher
      quality outcomes.
      Few qualities of mine are:
      - Observer: ability to recognize and analyse overlooked details;
      - Team Player: always offering help and solutions as much as I can in
      order to maintain positive attitude and learning experiences;
      - Researcher: trying to merge data and information from different areas
      in order to learn and apply innovative solutions;
      - Perseverance: no fear of failures and always learning from my
      mistakes.
